**1. Java Development Kit (JDK)**
Ensure you have the latest version of JDK installed on your machine. To install Java, follow the steps below:
Installing the Latest JDK
Visit the official JDK download page:
Go to the Oracle JDK Downloads(https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads) page or the OpenJDK page.
Download the JDK:
Choose the latest version (for example, JDK 17 or JDK 20).
Select the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
Install the JDK:
Windows: Run the installer .exe file and follow the on-screen instructions.
macOS: Open the .dmg file and follow the installation instructions.
Linux: You can use package managers such as apt or yum, or install it from a .tar.gz file.
Verify the Installation:
Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows or terminal on macOS/Linux) and run:
java -version
You should see something like:
openjdk version "17.0.2" 2021-11-16
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 17.0.2+8-39)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.0.2+8-39, mixed mode)
This confirms that Java is installed correctly.
**Step 2: Set Up Java Environment Variable**
Once the Java installation is done, set up the Java Environment Variable. To set the Java environment variable, open System Settings.
Go to My Computer and select Properties by Right-Clicking on empty space in My Computer.
Click on 'Change settings'.
A pop-up window will display, click on 'Advanced' tab and then click on 'Environment Variables'.
Click on New button under 'System Variables'
Write 'JAVA_HOME' in the Variable name box and enter 'C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_20' JDK path in the Variable value box and click OK.
Entry for newly created Java variable will be displayed under 'System Variables..'
**2. Eclipse IDE (or any Java IDE)**
Eclipse is recommended for Java development. If you don’t have it already:
Download Eclipse: Visit Eclipse Downloads and download the latest version of Eclipse IDE for Java Developers.
Install Eclipse: Follow the instructions to install Eclipse on your operating system.
Set up Java in Eclipse: Eclipse should automatically detect the JDK you installed. If not, you can configure it in Window > Preferences > Java > Installed JREs.
**3. Maven (Optional)**
If you are using Maven to manage dependencies (as in the case with this project), ensure you have Maven installed:
Download Maven: Visit Maven Downloads(https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and download the latest version.
Set up Maven: Follow the installation guide for your operating system.
Verify Maven Installation:
mvn -version
Install the Maven Plugin in Eclipse (if not already installed)
Eclipse comes with built-in Maven support. If it isn't already installed, you can add it by following these steps:
Open Eclipse IDE.
Go to Help > Eclipse Marketplace.
Search for Maven Integration for Eclipse.
Click Go and then Install.
Restart Eclipse when prompted.
Creating and Configuring pom.xml
In a Maven project, the pom.xml file is where dependencies and build configurations are defined.
Add Dependencies: For example, if you're using JUnit for tests, add the following to the dependencies section of your pom.xml file:
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>junit</groupId>
        <artifactId>junit</artifactId>

**Page Object Model (POM) for Login and Product Pages**
In this project, we have implemented the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to enhance the maintainability, reusability, and readability of test scripts.
Overview of Page Object Model
The Page Object Model (POM) is a design pattern used in test automation to create an object-oriented class that serves as an interface to a web page. The idea behind POM is to separate the logic of interacting with the UI elements from the test scripts. This makes the test scripts more readable, reusable, and easier to maintain.
Each page of the web application is represented by a corresponding page object class. These classes contain the web elements (UI components) and methods to interact with them. This reduces the duplication of code and helps in maintaining tests when the UI changes.
Page Objects Created in This Project
LoginPage (Page Object for Login Screen):
The LoginPage class is a representation of the login screen in the application. It contains the following functionalities:
UI Elements:
Username input field
Password input field
Login button
Methods:
EnterUsername(): Enters the username in the login form.
EnterPassword(): Enters the password in the login form.
clickLogin(): Clicks the login button to submit the form.
This class abstracts the interactions with the login form and provides an easy interface for test scripts to log into the application.
Products (Page Object for Product List Screen):
The Products class represents the product listing page that appears after logging into the application. It contains the following functionalities:
UI Elements:
Product title
List of products
Methods:
getTitle(): Returns the page title, which is displayed after a successful login and redirection to the product page.
This class abstracts the interactions with the products page and provides an easy interface for test scripts to retrieve the page title or interact with the product listings.
Integration in Test Cases
In the Login_standard_user test case, we used the LoginPage and Products classes as follows:
Login Process:
We created an object of the LoginPage class and used its methods to enter the username, password, and click the login button.
Product Page Validation:
After logging in, we created an object of the Products class and validated the page title to ensure the login was successful.
**Running Your Selenium Test**
